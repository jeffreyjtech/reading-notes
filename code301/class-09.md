# Read 09 - Functional Programming

## [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

1. What is functional programming?
    - Functional programming is an programming paradigm where all computation is modelled as a mathematical function. The state of an execution sequence should only effect and be affected within the function that is being performed.

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
    - A pure function returns the same result if given the same argument(s) (AKA functions are deterministic) and they cause no observable side effects. A pure function will never use a mutable global variable to perform an operation, cannot read the contents of a file (file contents can change), and do not generate or otherwise use random numbers.

    ***

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
    - Pure functions are easier to test and easier to predict. They can be an effective tool for managing complexity as their usage minimizes the possible number of states that the program can be in at a given moment.

    ***

4. What is immutability?
    - Immutability is the quality of data or logic which cannot be changed after it has been created.

    ***

5. What is Referential transparency?
    - Referential transparency is the quality of a function which returns the same result for the same input.

1. What is a module?
    - A module is a group of code which has a specific, aligned purpose in the application.

    ***

2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
