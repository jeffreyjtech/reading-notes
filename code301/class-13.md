1. ***What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?***
Computers started hitting the consumer market, and they were heavily towards men and boys. It really goes to show the immense power that advertising (media in general) has in affecting human development. In this case, it affects by manipulating parents' buying habits.
2. ***Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?***
Anyone learning about computers in college clearly have a leg-up if they've used a computer their whole life. I postulate that computer literacy has probably become an assumed skill for learning programming, and individuals who lack computer literacy because of their background are unfairly disadvantaged. Probably for generations.

1. ***What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?***
    - Female, non-white or non-asian, are chronically under-represented demographics in the tech industry.

    - CEOs and our lawmakers are overwhelming white and male.

As stated in the article, YouTube's iOS app was built by a team entirely of right-handed people. The lack of left-handed developers surely is a leading factor in 5%-10% of videos being uploaded upside-down. An example from my life, privileged as it is, is that video-gamers used be hyper-stereotyped in traditional media. Many stories suffered from it and I never could engage with them.
