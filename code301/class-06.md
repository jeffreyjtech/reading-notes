## [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. **What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**
    1. Increased efficiency by catching mistakes earlier and producing high quality code which is "right the first time".
    2. Higher engagement of participants in the task at hand, since they can keep each other on track and rely on each other for help.
    3. Improve learning opportunities while writing code since two skill-sets are present and can be shared in the exercise.
    4. Social skills are practiced extensively in pair programming, which improves communication skills overall in the future.
    5. Readiness for job interviews is improved since the participants will have learned the vocabulary and the grammar needed to explain and understand technical concepts when working with interviewers.
    6. Modern work environments use pair programming to train new hires, so practicing it now will ease that process in future employment.

    ***

2. **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**
    - I've found that pair programming increases my confidence and expertise with skills that I am weak on. It also makes me feel less isolated and more fluent in communication as a developer. This question isn't asking for this, but I am compelled to mention that pair programming feels incredibly draining for me, and the previously-mentioned benefits were counteracted when I've had a serious disagreement with my partner.

    ***

3. **How does pair programming work?**
    - A pair of developers work on a programming task. One developer is responsible for typing the code, while the other is responsible for directing the other. These roles are called the Driver and Navigator respectively. Sometimes the developers will swap roles before completing the pair programming session.
