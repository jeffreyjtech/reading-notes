# Read 04 - React and Forms

## [React Docs - Forms](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

## [The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained](https://codeburst.io/javascript-the-conditional-ternary-operator-explained-cac7218beeff)

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?
    - Ternary operators allow simple if/else conditional logic to be written in a shorter form. It's less code which accomplishes the same thing in one line which would otherwise take up 5, and that's less stuff to write.
2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```javascript
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}
```

- `(x===y) ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);`
