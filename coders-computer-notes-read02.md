# The Coder's Computer reading notes

## Choosing a text editor

Choosing a text editor depends very much on what your personal preferences are and what kind of development work you will be doing. All text editors, even as basic as Notepad, will produce a usable final output for whatever file you are authoring (assuming the code written inside works). Therefore, a good text editor will be easy for you to use and provide useful features for whatever programming language or markup language that you are working with.

## Terminal

The terminal provides an easy and fast way to speak with your computer and various software development tools such as Git.

### Terminal command cheat-sheet

- `mv` moves or renames files
- `cd` changes working directory
- `rm` deletes files
  - the -r argument allows it to delete folders
- `mkdir` creates a folder
- `pwd` prints the current directory's path
- `ls` prints the current directory's contents
  - writing in a path will perform this command on that path instead of the current directory
- `tree` prints a layout of the current directory's contents and all its subdirectory's contents
  - writing in a path will perform this command on that path instead of the current directory
