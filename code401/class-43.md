## [Why devs contribute to OSS](https://clearcode.cc/blog/why-developers-contribute-open-source-software/)

1. Contributing to OSS is a great opportunity to practice coding skills outside of your normal job environment or your own projects. You can learn just by seeing other people's code. Adjusting to the conventions of a different and unfamiliar project is also a learning opportunity.
1. Contributions to OSS can be a critical stepping stone for inexperienced developers, giving them real world development experience which will be valued by future employers.
1. OSS contributors can gain recognition by the community. Recognition by peers can lead to networking opportunities and, for hardcore developers, a sense of accomplishment for major OSS contributions.
1. An OSS contribution is a public addition to your portfolio, increasing your job prospects.
1. Finally, OSS is something that you personally can improve. If you or your employer's commercial software use OSS, you can add onto it to make it more useful for your own needs (and hopefully other's needs as well).
