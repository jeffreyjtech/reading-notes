# Prework - SQL Practice

## Notes

I think I have a good understanding now of how SQL databases work and how to interact with them on a basic level. I'm assuming it's critically useful when sorting extremely large amounts of data to have straightforward schemas for all of your data. I can already see how powerful the SQL query language even as a novice. It has full CRUD capabilities with `CREATE`/`INSERT`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`/`ALTER`, and `DELETE`/`DROP`. On top of that, you can do advanced queries using tools like its verbs `JOIN`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, it's ability to evaluate expressions, and it's ability compare data between columns dynamically.

As a novice user, I really appreciate the consistency of using `WHERE` to define conditions for multiple types of actions.
