# Prework - The Command Line

## Notes

- ***The Command Line***: I've known about the command line for most of my life but I did not know what a shell really is. It's good to know the difference. The terminal is an ultra-generic concept and a basic part of any OS, but the shell tells you what flavor of terminal you'll be interacting with. I also didn't know that `echo` is a command to display messages.
- ***Basic Navigation***:
  - It's crazy how many options there are for something as simple as `ls`. Also the meta-data that appears when using `ls -l` is very interesting. Super technical stuff I'm sure but it's always neat to see the nuts-and-bolts of a file system.
  - I wish I knew 3 months ago that `cd` with no args moves you to the home directory.
  - Thankfully as a 201 and 301 graduate I already know what the essential function of `pwd`, `ls`, and `cd`. I will reiterate them anyways:
    - `pwd` - Prints the path of the working directory.
    - `ls` - Prints the contents of a directory.
    - `cd` - Changes the working directory.
