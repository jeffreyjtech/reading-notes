# Read 42 - Ethics in Tech

## [The Code I'm Still Ashamed Of](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

This article deeply resonates with me. Something that's always given me food-for-thought is the values that are expressed when an engineer or any STEM professional makes just about any decision. Business requirements for what you build can often seem value-free decisions: You either build something to spec, or you don't, and the latter might seem like a failure to do your job. How it affects the end user is "not your job".

As the article's author much regrets, fulfilling business requirements can have severe negatives effects on users. His work ended up misleading people about the severity of their depression, which the product it was advertising was meant to treat, and resulted in someone's suicide. Satisfying his business client meant creating something which he never wanted a part of.

This echoes with my personal work experiences. I worked in factory which built defibrillators. The quality of the product was paramount. Defibrillators are dangerous machines and people can live or die depending on their proper functioning. I regularly reviewed the work of technical professionals who took the ethics of their work seriously and those who did not. Their values were self-evident in the quality of what they made.

Major improvements to the way we did business were rooted in a deep and thoughtful consideration for the values expressed in our work: integrity, transparency, reliability. There were many times where it would have been easy to take shortcuts or be a yes-man to my immediate internal customers. But I remembered what made my work important, and that gave me the confidence to say no and exercise due diligence.

This article reinforces that lesson, that your decisions as an engineer or a developer can have broader consequences. If something does not feel right, you owe it to yourself to ask questions and raise concerns. Software becomes more embedded into our lives and the world every day. So too must our values be embedded into our software, else we will make a world which we regret living in.

## [Big Data is our Civil Rights issue](http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/)

Big Data has caused a sea change in how information is gathered about individuals and society. I agree with all of the major points in this article. Data which can directly impact my life and the life of the people around me is essentially floating about, uncontrolled and unregulated in who-knows how many business and institutions. This can then be weaponized against me, or used to grant me unseen privilege over others. Personalization which affects your credit limit and your insurance costs is *de facto* discrimination. I believe that corporations need to be held accountable for creating disparity in our society with such data usage. There are great things that can be accomplished with Big Data, in the realms of public health, education, corporate accountability, and so on. But organizations should really only have access to what they need to know and not what they want to know.
