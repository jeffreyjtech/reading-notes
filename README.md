My first CodeFellows GitHub Repo with notes on Growth Mindset

## Growth Mindset Notes

Growth mindset means many things to me:
1. The desire to improve
2. Seeing mistakes as opportunities
3. Openness to new ideas

I can remind myself to stay in a growth mindset with the following axioms:

- There's always something new to learn
  - Failure is giving up, not making mistakes
  - Every learning process has a pit

>Growth mindset is the path to success!
