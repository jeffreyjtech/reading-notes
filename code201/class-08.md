## Duckett HTML/CSS book: Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)

I took fairly thorough notes of Chapter 15, linked [here](https://jeffreyjtech.github.io/reading-notes/code201/class-04#html--chapter-15-layout-pp358-404).

I missed the `sticky` value as an option for the `position` attribute, but it's covered in the outline above.
