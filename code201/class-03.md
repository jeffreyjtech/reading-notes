## HTML | Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)

HTML has elements for inserting lists of different types into HTML documents:

- Unordered lists
- Ordered lists
- Definition list
- Nested lists

## HTML | Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)

CSS can interact with the "boxes" laid out by HTML to change their size. Different size properties exist with different effects:

- Dimensions
- Limiting width
- Limiting height
- Overflow

Padding and margin properties are used to add whitespace inside of and outside of a box, respectively. Every box can also have a border of varying thickness. This border is primarily for visual separation of items using lines/dots/color, but it's thickness is added onto the box's total size'

Centering a box can be done with left-margin and right-margin auto.
